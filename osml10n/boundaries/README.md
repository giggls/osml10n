## Boundaries

These boundaries are used by the transcription server. They can be recreated
from OSM data with the script `get_osm_boundaries.sh`. The script needs
[osmium-tool](https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/).

The boundaries must be in GeoJSON format with a property `cc` containing the
ISO country code.
